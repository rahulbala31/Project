Library Management System: Project Report
1. Project Overview:
The Library Management System is a Java application designed to facilitate the efficient management of a library's operations. It provides functionalities for managing books, users, and the borrowing/returning process using object-oriented programming principles.

2. Objectives:
Automate Library Operations: Streamline book management and user interactions.
Implement OOP Concepts: Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Enhance Efficiency: Simplify book inventory management and user transactions.
3. Features:
Book Management:

Add Books: Librarians can input new book details including title, author, and ISBN.
Remove Books: Ability to remove books from the library’s collection by title.
List Books: Display all books with details such as title, author, and issuance status.
User Management:

Member: Users can borrow and return books, with tracking of borrowed books.
Librarian: Manages the book collection and performs administrative tasks.
Book Issuance and Return:

Borrow Book: Members can borrow available books, which are marked as issued.
Return Book: Members can return books, updating their availability.
4. Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Data Structures: ArrayList for dynamic book and user management
5. OOP Concepts Applied:
Encapsulation: Private attributes with public getters and setters.
Inheritance: Member and Librarian classes extend User.
Abstraction: User class as an abstract base class.
Polymorphism: Unified interface for different user types.
6. Conclusion:
The Library Management System demonstrates effective use of Java and OOP principles to create a functional and scalable library management solution. The system enhances efficiency and provides a foundation for future improvements.
